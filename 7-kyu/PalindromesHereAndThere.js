/**
 * An array is given with palindromic and non-palindromic numbers. A palindromic number is a number that is the same from a reversed order. For example 122 is not a palindromic number, but 202 is one.

Your task is to write a function that returns an array with only 1s and 0s, where all palindromic numbers are replaced with a 1 and all non-palindromic numbers are replaced with a 0.

For example:

[101, 2, 85, 33, 14014]  ==>  [1, 1, 0, 1, 0]
[45, 21, 303, 56]        ==>  [0, 0, 1, 0]
 */

// solution 

function convertPalindromes(numbers) {
    return numbers.map(x =>  {
      if ( x == x.toString().split('').reverse().join('') ){
          return 1} else {
            return 0
          }
    }) 
  };
